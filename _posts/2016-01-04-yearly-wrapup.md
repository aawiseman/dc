2015 was a big year for MaptimeDC! We held 12 events, everything from [learning QGIS] (http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-DC/events/225100092/) to [using the city's open data] (http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-DC/events/220741310/) to [helping map Nepal on OpenStreetMap] (http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-DC/events/220505118/) after the earthquake there so humanitarian groups will have better maps. We also held project nights where we came together and worked on different ideas together (and ate pizza!)

We're planning our meetups for this year, and if you have any ideas for topics, or want to teach one yourself, let us know! You can follow us and contact us on [our Twitter] (http://twitter.com/MaptimeDC) or our [Meetup page] (http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-DC/). And we hope to see everyone soon!
